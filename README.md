# Blog Platform

This repository contains the source code and files for my second React task in CodSoft's internship, a blog platform that allows users to authenticate, create, read, and publish blogs.

## The primary functionalities include:
1. View Blogs: Users can seamlessly explore a collection of blogs, providing a rich and engaging reading experience.
2. Write & Publish: Express yourself! Authenticated users can easily pen down their thoughts, create engaging content, and share it with the world.
3. Delete with Ease: Oops, changed your mind? No worries! A nifty delete feature lets users manage their content hassle-free.
(Each user can have the privilege to delete ONLY his blogs)
4. Firebase Authentication: Security is a top priority. The platform ensures that only authenticated users can access the writing and deletion features, enhancing the overall user experience.

In the project directory, you can run:
